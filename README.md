# Finding the closest inaugural speech to Trump's 2017 address 
* This project aims to search the closest inaugural speech to Trump's speech in 2017 using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
* A dataframe containing the dot product of term-frequency (TF) and inverse-document-frequency (IDF) for each inaugural speech is created. With this dataframe, the closest inaugural speech is computed based on cosine similarity. As a result, inaugural speech made by President Clinton in 1993, President Bush's speech in 2005 and President Obama's speech in 2013 were selected as the closest speech to Trump's address.
